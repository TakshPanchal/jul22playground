# Clustering Resources to Explore

Clustering is an unsupervised Machine Learning-based Algorithm that comprises a group of data points into clusters so that the objects belong to the same group. Clustering helps to splits data into several subsets. Each of these subsets contains data similar to each other, and these subsets are called clusters.
